SaberMod
========

This is a *Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast* 1.04 mod targeting
competitive community. It is developed by *SaberMod team* (see
Authors_) and draws inspiration from all id Tech 3 based games and
mods, trying to improve on usability, stability and user experience
with *no-gimmicks* approach. Our first goal is reimplementing and
improving on the features of popular *league mod* by XycaleTh.

This code is based on `JK2 SDK GPL`_ - an updated JK2 1.04 SDK.

Build
=====

Linux
-----

You will need GNU Make and GCC or Clang compiler. Type ``make`` to
build .so files in base/ and .qvm files in base/vm/ You can add
``-jN`` option to speed up the build process by running N jobs
simultaneously. Type ``make help`` to learn about other targets.

Assume your mod is called "mymod" and your main JK2 directory is
~/.jkii In order to test the mod, put .qvm files in ~/.jkii/mymod/vm/
and launch the game with ``+set fs_game mymod`` commandline parameter.

To debug your mod use generated .so files. Put them in ~/.jkii/mymod/
and launch the game with ``+set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui
0`` commandline parameters. Set them back to 2 when you want to use
.qvm version again.

Windows
-------

Currently there is no support for building shared libraries on
Windows. Old ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch file should work for QVMs if
you can get lcc and q3asm tools (eg from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*) and
put them into bin/ directory.

I'll be glad to include Windows build scripts, project files etc. if
you can create and test them.

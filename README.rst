JK2 SDK GPL
===========

This is an alternative *Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast* SDK2
released under the GPLv2 license. Search for *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*
if you'd like to get familiar with original SDK for 1.04 version
released by Raven Software in 2003, containing also tools and guides
for creating maps, models and other modifications.

Creating this repository has been made possible thanks to Raven
Software releasing JK2 source code in 2013. This branch contains an
altered subset of it, necessary for creating code mods, with few
indisputable cleanups and bug fixes.

Build
=====

Windows
-------

Currently there is no support for building VM or .dll files on
Windows. Old ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch file should work for VMs if
you can get lcc and q3asm tools (eg from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*) and
put them into bin/ directory.

I'd be glad to include Windows build scripts, project files etc. if
you can create and test them.

License
=======

JK2 SDK 1.04 is licensed under GPLv2 as free software. Read
LICENSE.txt and readme-raven.txt to learn more. According to it, among
other things, you are obliged to distribute full source code of your
mods alongside them, or at least a written offer to ship it (eg a
HTTP download link inside a .pk3 file)

Trivia
------

Did you know that, compared to *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0* license, GPLv2
doesn't prohibit you from:

* Distributing your mod by means other than internet and even charging
  for it.

* Creating mods which infringe against third party rights, are
  libelous, defamatory, obscene, false, misleading and otherwise
  illegal and unlawful.

* Shipping them to countries to which the U.S. has embargoed goods and
  to people who are prohibited by applicable law from receiving it.
